## Turtle library
**turtle** is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name. In short, the Python turtle library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way.

### Coordinate system
The screen is divided into four quadrants. The point where the turtle is initially positioned at the beginning of your program is (0,0)
